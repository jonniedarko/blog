So This is My First Post on my new Jekyll Blog, It is a work in progress but I hope over the comming weeks/months and hopefully years to be able to make it a lot more attractive and functional as I add more Posts.

What Kind of Posts will I be making? I'll be starting off with Angularjs & Node. I plan on documenting anything I learn as I go along so you may see some random posts (some cases they maybe Rants) with my opininon on Movies & Tv Shows, books, Gadgets and life in General.
