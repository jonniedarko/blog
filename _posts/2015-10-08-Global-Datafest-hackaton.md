# London Hackathon - Global DataFest Hackathon
For Fun a Couple of friends (Martin, Victor & Dave) and I entered into a Hackathon in London, it was an excuse to visit some friends in London. Turns out we actually met and worked with some pretty cool people and ended up not just winning 1st place in London but also took 1st place in one of the Categories in the Global Hackathon.

Below is a Summary from our project entry page.
